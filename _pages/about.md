<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a PhD student at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Virginia Tech, USA. Presently, I am working in the domain of Human-Robot Interaction at Collaborative Robotics Lab (Collab) at Virginia Tech under the guidance of [Dr. Dylan Losey](https://dylanlosey.com/).

I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering with minor in Robotics and Mobility Systems at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Jodhpur in 2021. During my Bachelors, I was working under the supervision of [Dr. Suril Shah](http://surilshah.weebly.com/). I am grateful that I have had the opportunity to work with [Dr. Atul Thakur](http://www.iitp.ac.in/~athakur/index.html) during my internship at Mechatronics, Instrumentation and Control (MICL) Lab at IIT Patna. 

My research interests include Human-Robot Interaction and Perception based Manipulation and Control, and am forever looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge in these ever-evolving fields.

Besides research, I love travelling, exploring new cultures and meeting new people. -->
